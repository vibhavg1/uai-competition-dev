We are pleased to announce an upcoming evaluation of probabilistic approximate inference algorithms and machine learning multi-label classification algorithms 
as part of the UAI 2022 conference.
<!-- All researchers working on inference in graphical models and statistical relational models are encouraged to participate.-->

## Evaluation Tasks
- PR:  computation of the partition function
- MAR: computation of marginal probabilities
- MAP: computation the most likely assignment over all variables
- MMAP: computation the most likely assignment to a subset of variables maximizing the MAR on the remaining variables 
- MLC: multi-label classification of a subset of variables
